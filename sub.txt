Amen.
And with your Spirit
and to you,
my brothers and sisters that I have greatly sinned,
in my thoughts and in words, 
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do, 
through my fault, 
through my fault,
through my most grievous fault; 
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin, 
all the Angels and Saints, 
and you, my brothers and sisters, 
to pray for me to the Lord our God.
Amen.
Amen.
Thanks be to God.
Thanks be to God.
And with your spirit.
Glory to you O Lord.
Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.
Amen.
May the Lord accept the sacrifice 
at your hands for the praise and glory of his name,
for our good and the good of all his holy Church.
Amen.
And with your spirit
We lift them up to the Lord
It is right and just
For the Kingdom, the power and the glory are Yours,
now and forever.
Amen.
And with your spirit
Peace be with you.
Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof,
but only say the Word and my soul shall be healed.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Who made heaven and earth.
And with your spirit.
Amen.
